## Abstract

We present a simple comparison of using the rectified linear units (ReLU) activation function, and a number of its variations, in a deep neural network. We present empirical results comparing ReLU functions with Logistic and Hyperbolic Tangent functions in image classification, text classification, and image reconstruction.
